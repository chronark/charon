# Charon
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/chronark/charon/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/chronark/charon)

Backend services for caching and displaying geospatial data



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your system. This is intended to run on an ubuntu machine but can be run anywhere you have docker installed.

### Prerequisites

- Make
- Docker

To install docker follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) or use the install script:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

### Deployment

There are a couple of steps to run the services.

0. Build all necessary docker images if you don't have them alrady.
```sh
make build
```

1. Get and initialize Terraform, a infrastructure management and provisioning tool.
```sh
make init
```

2. Create a terraform plan
```
make plan
```

3. Apply the plan
```
make apply
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Services
![Architecture](https://github.com/chronark/charon/blob/master/architecture.jpeg?raw=true)

### Filecache
Discovery name: `charon.srv.filecache`

Filecache is a basic cache that writes or reads bytes to and from the disk.

### Gateway
The HTTP API gateway to interact with all microservices. Exposes various routes to fetch data.
Listens on port 52000
Routes:
- `/geocoding/forward?query=XYZ` calls the geocoding service.
- `/geocoding/reverse?lat=1.0&lon=1.0` calls the geocoding service.
- `/tiles?x=0&y=0&z=0`calls the tiles service.

### Geocoding
Discovery name: `charon.srv.geocoding.nominatim` or `charon.srv.geocoding.mapbox`

Geocoding has two handlers:  [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
They both receive a forward or reverse geocoding search and search the cache. In case of a miss they will query their respective 3rd party APIs, write to cache and return the result.

### Tiles
Discovery name: `charon.srv.tiles.osm` or `charon.srv.geocoding.mapbox`

Tiles has two handlers:  [osm](https://openstreetmap.org/) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
They both receive a tile request and search the cache. In case of a miss they will query their respective 3rd party APIs, write to cache and return the result.


## Built With

* [go](https://golang.org/)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - Infrastructure management
* [go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) - Microservice framework

## Development

Charon makes use of protobuf for the internal communication. In order to compile the protobuf definition you need to install:
```sh
go get google.golang.org/grpc
go get github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
go get github.com/micro/protoc-gen-micro
```

Then run `make proto` to compile all protobuf definitions at once.
